This Node appliction is meant to serve as a companion to the website I built in the front end development class. What you see is an admin site for a tour company. The form allows employees to add new events, after which the events are displayed. They can then be deleted or updated. The Mongo database is hosted on mLab.com. Instead of a front end framework, I used ejs for templating and jQuery for the client-side interface. The two projects will be hosted and combined as a portfolio piece.
